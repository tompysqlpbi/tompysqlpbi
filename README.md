I am Data Analyst with 4+ year experience.

Iâ€™m currently working on mine projects and as data analyst in sport industry. 

For example in my free time I predict the odds from historical data.

I am developing report for NHL Yahoo fantasy For better estimation to better player pick.

Next of my projects is to monitor my favourite stocks and cryptocurrencies in Power BI with real time data.

Also I am improving my skills with Power BI and Python and SQL.

I love to work with the data. Analyse them, sort them, predict from them and compare histrical data against current data.

Mostly I work with sport data and financial data.

I can webscrape the data, read JSON fromat and work with API.
